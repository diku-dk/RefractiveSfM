﻿# RefractiveSfMThis repository contains code for refractive structure-from-motion.## IntroductionExample code for verify  the algorithms described in:> Absolute and Relative Pose Estimation in Refractive Multi View> In Submission to ICCV 2021## Side contribution1. We extend Agrawal's open-source implementation to handle single refraction and double refraction with three different media. 2. We implement the algorithms described in the following articles. Furthermore, we accelerate them using the virtual camera transformation.> Chadebecq, François, et al. "Refractive two-view reconstruction for underwater 3d vision." International Journal of Computer Vision 128.5 (2020): 1101-1117.> Chadebecq, François, et al. "Refractive structure-from-motion through a flat refractive interface." Proceedings of the ieee international conference on computer vision. 2017.## How-to-use`main_absolute_pose_toy_example.m` : generate synthetic data for evaluating absolution pose estimation.`main_relative_pose_toy_example.m` : generate synthetic data for evaluating relative pose estimation.### Dependencies:Some certain functions have dependencies on [mexopencv](https://github.com/kyamagu/mexopencv) library.Please following the instructions mentioned in the  [mexopencv](https://github.com/kyamagu/mexopencv) repository for compilation and installation.UPnP and GPnP rely on installation of the OpenGV library.## AcknowledgementsIn folder `thirdparty`, we include some third-party software made by:> 1.
